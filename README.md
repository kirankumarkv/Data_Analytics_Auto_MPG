# Data_Analytics_Auto_MPG

MPG Auto Data Analytics Project
Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the Auto MPG dataset to predict fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) using machine learning techniques. It serves as a hands-on resource for M.Tech AI students to practice data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), regression modeling, and interpretability techniques.

Dataset Description
The Auto MPG Dataset contains fuel efficiency data for vehicles from the 1970s and 1980s, with attributes such as:

mpg: Miles per gallon (target variable).
cylinders: Number of cylinders.
displacement: Engine displacement (cubic inches).
horsepower: Engine horsepower.
weight: Vehicle weight (lbs).
acceleration: Acceleration (0-60 mph in seconds).
model year: Year of manufacture.
origin: Origin of the vehicle (1: USA, 2: Europe, 3: Japan).
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (Link).

Learning Objectives
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand relationships between features and fuel efficiency.
Implement data preprocessing techniques (handling missing values, normalization, feature engineering).
Build and evaluate regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks).
Interpret model results using tools like SHAP or LIME.
Compare traditional ML models vs. deep learning approaches.
